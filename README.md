Outcome

1. Ability to work with Java
Programming Constructs
2. Ability to work with basic
git flows.

GIT Flow Expectations

• Create Repo for Shell Scripts
• Add and Commit Files
• Follow Message Hygiene
• During Commit specify Add or Refactor in
the message beginning
• Create Branch
• Push to Remote Master and Branch
• Merge and Resolve Conflicts
• Ability to look into History of Files
• Comfortable with Git Commands

Java Programming
Expectations
• Use of Java Programming Constructs
• Use of proper names for the File Names,
Variables and Constants
• Use of Proper Indentations
• Avoiding Printing to standard terminal
instead use debug
• No Commented Codes
• Follow DRY Principle – Do not Repeat
Yourself
• Comfortable with Debug Execution Threads

Rules

• Start with Welcome message in the Main Branch
• Every Use Case (UC) in the Corresponding UC Branch
• For e.g. UC-1 Branch Name – EmployeeAttendanceUC
• Follow Programming Hygiene and DRY principle
• Testing the Program before pushing to Remote
• On Completion of every UC, do the following
• Merge Local Branch with Local Master
• Push to Remote Branch
• Merge Local Master with Local Branch
• Push Local Master to Remote Master

Comparison Computation
Program on Master Branch

START

UC 1

As a fan of geometry, I want to
model a line based on a point
consisting of (x, y) co

-ordinates
using the Cartesian system,
So that I can calculate its
length
.

- A Length as 2 Points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) - Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2

- y1) ^ 2)

UC 2

As a fan of geometry, I want to
check equality of two lines
based on the end points, So
that I know when two lines are
the equal. - Using Java equals method to check equality of 2 Lengths is
preferable.


UC 3

As a fan of geometry, I want to
compare two lines based on
the end points, So that I know
one line is equal, greater or
less than the other line. - Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths is
preferable.
